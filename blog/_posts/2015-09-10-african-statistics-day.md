<img src="/images/african_statistics_day_2015_poster.jpg" alt="African Statistics Day poster" style="width:300px"><br><br>On 18 November every year, African countries celebrate <a href="http://www.uneca.org/asd2015" target="_blank">African Statistics Day (ASD)</a> to raise public awareness about the importance of statistics in supporting decision making in all dimensions of sustainable development. This celebration provides an opportunity for each country to take stock of its achievements and challenges in monitoring progress towards national, regional and global development goals.

The theme of the African Statistics Day this year is “Better data for better lives: Harnessing modern technology to enhance national statistical systems”. In this way, the African continent is linking to the World Statistics Day 2015 global celebration, with a renewed call to strengthen the continent's national statistical systems that will be responsible for providing key information to follow up and review the new <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&Lang=E" target="_blank">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.
