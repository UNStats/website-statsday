The mugs are a great way of inviting conference participants, contributors to census and guests to the Statistics Bureau of Japan to join the celebration of the World Statistics Day 2015.

The Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plays a central role in the official statistical system of Japan. It is responsible for the production, compilation and dissemination of official statistics which are fundamental to monitor the socio-economic conditions of the country.

Japan is co-sponsor of the [United Nations General Assembly resolution]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-06-03-general-assembly-resolution %}) designating 20 October 2015 as second World Statistics Day under the general theme *"Better data. Better lives."*
