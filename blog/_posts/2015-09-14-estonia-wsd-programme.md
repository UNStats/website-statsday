---
<a href="http://www.stat.ee" target="_blank">Statistics Estonia</a> is planning a number of exciting events on and around 20 October to celebrate World Statistics Day 2015.

On the day itself, Statistics Estonia in cooperation with the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/Estonian_Statistical.html" target="_blank">Estonian Statistical Society</a> is organizing a one-day conference. The main office in Tallinn will open its doors to the general public and offer guided tours to visitors. Part of the tour will be a short presentation on the work of Statistics Estonia. Another great way to engage users will be a statistical quiz, which will be launched on the website of <a href="http://www.stat.ee" target="_blank">Statistics Estonia</a> on 19 October. The quiz will be available online throughout the week.
