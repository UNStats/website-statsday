---

This year marks the 95th anniversary of Belarus' <a href="http://www.belstat.gov.by/en/" target="_blank">Central Statistical Bureau (Belstat)</a>. To celebrate this anniversary and the second World Statistics Day, the Bureau has launched a series of contests and activities that promote and encourage user engagement.

<a href="www.stat.ee" target="_blank">Statistics Estonia</a> is planning a number of exciting events on and around 20 October to celebrate World Statistics Day 2015.

On the day itself, Statistics Estonia in cooperation with the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/Estonian_Statistical.html" target="_blank">Estonian Statistical Society</a> is organizing a one-day conference. The main office in Tallinn will open its doors to the general public and offer guided tours to visitors. Part of the tour will be a short presentation on the work of Statistics Estonia. Another great way to engage users will be a statistical quiz, which will be launched on the website of <a href="www.stat.ee" target="_blank">Statistics Estonia</a> on 19 October. The quiz will be available online throughout the week.
