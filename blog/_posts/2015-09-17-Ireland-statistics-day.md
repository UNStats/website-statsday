title: 2015 marks the bicentenary of the birth of George Boole
---

In its resolution declaring 20 October 2015 as <a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/2015/06/03/general-assembly-resolution/" target="_blank">the second World Statistics Day </a>, the United Nations General Assembly noted that this year also marks the bicentenary of the birth of George Boole, whose work on the application of the principles of logic as a form of algebra underpins modern computer science. A new 58-minute film commissioned by <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">University College Cork </a>shines new light on the legacy of George Boole, recognised as the forefather of the information age.

The huge impact of George Boole’s work on technology today is explored in <a href="http://www.georgeboole.com/film/" target="_blank">The Genius of George Boole, a stunning new film narrated by Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons and produced by multi award-winning Oxford Film and Television.  It assembles academics and industry leaders from across the globe to explore the life and importance of one of the world’s greatest unsung heroes.

World-renowned film producer and Ireland’s digital champion, Lord Puttnam, sets film with the question: “Is George Boole important?” Puttnam continues: “I guess, no George Boole, no Google, no Amazon, no Intel…that makes him pretty important,” leaving no doubt that Boole is indeed a key figure in our digital age. Dealing with the themes of genius and what motivates genius, the film looks at Boole's legacy with special references to how Boole research has been applied in today's world. The film also touches on the historic contexts of Ireland, Cork and UCC as well as England in the early nineteenth century.

The film, which was recently shown on national television in Ireland, will be shown at the United Nations HQ in New York on World Statistics Day courtesy of the <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">University College Cork</a> in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/pmun/newyork/" target="_blank">Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations</a>.
