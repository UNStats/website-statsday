To promote the <a href ="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/statistical_literacy/wsd2015/index.jsp" target="_blank">World Statistics Day 2015</a> and 2016 Population By-census, <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/" target="_blank">the Census and Statistics Department</a> took part in <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/pastprojects/bf2015/index.jsp" target="_blank">Hong Kong Book Fair 2015</a> held from 15-21 July 2015 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. 

The Department's booth was located at the General Books Pavilion and exhibited panels giving details of the World Statistics Day 2015 and the 2016 Population By-census. The Department received favourable responses from the public, as visitors came to the booth to try the e-questionnaire of the 2016 Population By-census and play a challenging interactive computer quiz game.

Another initiative in the context of World Statistics Day 2015 was the delivery of a statistical talk on <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/statistical_literacy/wsd2015/uits/index.jsp" target="_blank">“Understanding Innovation and Technology Statistics”</a> at the Lecture Hall of the Hong Kong Science Museum on 5 September 2015. The speaker, Ms Alvina KWAN, Senior Statistician, outlined the salient features of the innovation and technology statistics compiled by the Census and Statistics Department during the talk.
