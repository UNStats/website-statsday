<img src="/images/MDGReport2015.png" alt="MDG2015 Report" style="width:200px"><br><br>Following the launch of the [2015 Millennium Development Goals Report](http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Default.aspx), the United Nations Statistics Division is excited to announce the [#WSD2015 Data Visualization Challenge competition](https://unite.un.org/ideas/content/wsd2015-data-visualization-challenge) as part of the celebration around the World Statistics Day 2015.

In this competition, we challenge you to use your creativity and imagination to help answer a question relevant for development policy, by building an infographic or dynamic visualization featuring the latest data from the [2015 MDG report](http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Default.aspx).  For instance:

  - Find interlinkages, synergies and tradeoffs between different MDG goals and targets
  - Identify factors that help explain different levels of achievement across countries and regions
  - Or come up with your own questions to put your analytical and data visualization skills to the test!

The winner will be announced on 20 October 2015 - World Statistics Day 2015! A selection of the best visualizations received will be showcased on the [UNSD website](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/default.htm), as well as on the [Unite Ideas](https://unite.un.org/ideas/) website and other platforms worldwide.
