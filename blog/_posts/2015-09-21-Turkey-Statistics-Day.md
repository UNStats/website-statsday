The <a href="http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/" target="_blank" >Turkish Institute of Statistics (Turkstat)</a> will celebrate this year's World Statistics Day in many different ways. On 20 October, Turkstat will hold a panel discussion on “Better data. Better lives.” focusing on the importance of reliable statistics.  The panellists are Izak Atiyas (from academia), Prof.Dr. Güngör Uras (a journalist) and Mr. Tarhan Erdem (from research). The event will take place at Turkstat. In addition, all 26 regional offices will organise similar panels in collaboration with universities.

The office also prepared a range of advocacy material, incl. an article on the “Statistical System of Turkey: Past, Present and Future”, an interview with the director of Turkstat on the development of the national statistical system and a speech of the director launching World Statistics Day. Turkstat is also preparing a special press release “Statistics on Statistics” for the special day. Publicity material such as notepads and posters will be distributed in October and one lucky school in Ankara will receive a visit from Turkstat staff and receive an IT donation.  A dedicated website will be released by Turkstat by the end of September.
