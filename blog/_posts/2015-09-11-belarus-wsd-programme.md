This year marks the 95th anniversary of Belarus' <a href="http://www.belstat.gov.by/en/" target="_blank">Central Statistical Bureau (Belstat)</a>. To celebrate this anniversary and the second World Statistics Day, the Bureau has launched a series of contests and activities that promote and encourage user engagement.

A first contest, entitled "My profession is statistician", provides young statisticians the opportunity to present their profession to the general public from their own view point and experience. A second, entitled "Statistics for All", and invites students of the <a href="http://www.bseu.by/english/" target="_blank">Belarus State Economics University</a> to create infographics and analytical reviews that help make statistical information and insights accessible to everybody.

The Bureau is also organizing a "Day of Accessible Official Statistical Information" in the central office of BelStat as well as in the regional statistical offices. Secondary school students in their final year will get a special treat with a "Welcome Day" at Belstat. In addition, the Bureau is preparing a press release on the occasion of World Statistics Day 2015, and a new leaflet “Guide to the website of Belstat”. The World Statistics Day logo will feature prominently on the cover of various statistical publications of Belstat.

To reach as many users as possible, items about the celebration of the World Statistics Day will be included in agendas of thematic seminars and roundtables with users, respondents and academia organized by Belstat and Regional Statistical Offices over the next few weeks.
