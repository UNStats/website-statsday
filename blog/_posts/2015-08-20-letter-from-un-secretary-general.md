The Secretary-General pointed out in his letter that "statistics are critical for evidence-based decision making across all cultural and historical backgrounds of countries and irrespective of their level of development."  He also noted that, by <a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/2015/06/03/general-assembly-resolution/" target="_blank">designating 20 October 2015 as World Statistic Day</a> under the general theme "Better data, better lives", the United Nations General Assembly "acknowledged the fundamental importance of sustainable national statistical capacity to produce reliable and timely statistics and indicators."   The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.

In his message to all heads of state, the Secretary-General underlined that "solid data are an indispensable basis for informed policy formulation and for monitoring the post-2015 development agenda at the national, regional and international levels."  This aspect has particular significance today, as countries are finalizing more than two years of preparations which will culminate next month in the United Nations <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit" target="_blank">summit</a> for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, making a clear call for “quality, accessible, timely and reliable dissaggragated data...to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure no one is left behind”.
