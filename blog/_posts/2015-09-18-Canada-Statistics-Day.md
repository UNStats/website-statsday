title: Statistics Canada invites staff to take trip to the future
---
<a href=" http://www.statcan.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Statistics Canada</a> employees will be celebrating World Statistics Day in a special way. The agency invited their staff to submit their vision of the future of their agency and how it will look like in 2035. A group of selected employees will present to their co-workers their vision. The event will be broadcast to all Statistics Canada staff across the country. A reverse time capsule will be produced, so employees in 2035 can watch it during their own World Statistics Day celebration! 
Statistics Canada will also be hosting a panel discussion in Ottawa on official health statistics. First, a presentation will provide an overview of the Canadian Health Measures Survey and its objectives, collection processes and dissemination strategy. A panel discussion with Canadian experts from the public and private sectors will follow, along with audience questions. The session will focus on how health data are being used to address important health research questions and to develop emerging health-related policies.
Of course, Statistics Canada is also busy with preparing support material for their events such as web and intranet sites, videos, and other communications pieces.
