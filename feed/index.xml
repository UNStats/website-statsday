On 20 October, Turkstat will hold a panel discussion on “Better data. Better lives.” focusing on the importance of reliable statistics.  The panellists are Izak Atiyas (from academia), Prof.Dr. Güngör Uras (a journalist) and Mr. Tarhan Erdem (from research). The event will take place at Turkstat. In addition, all 26 regional offices will organise similar panels in collaboration with universities.</p>

<p>The office also prepared a range of advocacy material, incl. an article on the “Statistical System of Turkey: Past, Present and Future”, an interview with the director of Turkstat on the development of the national statistical system and a speech of the director launching World Statistics Day. Turkstat is also preparing a special press release “Statistics on Statistics” for the special day.

<p><a href=" http://www.statcan.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Statistics Canada</a> employees will be celebrating World Statistics Day in a special way. The agency invited their staff to submit their vision of the future of their agency and how it will look like in 2035. A group of selected employees will present to their co-workers their vision. The event will be broadcast to all Statistics Canada staff across the country. A reverse time capsule will be produced, so employees in 2035 can watch it during their own World Statistics Day celebration!</p>

<p>Statistics Canada will also be hosting a panel discussion in Ottawa on official health statistics. First, a presentation will provide an overview of the Canadian Health Measures Survey and its objectives, collection processes and dissemination strategy. A panel discussion with Canadian experts from the public and private sectors will follow, along with audience questions. The session will focus on how health data are being used to address important health research questions and to develop emerging health-related policies.
Of course, Statistics Canada is also busy with preparing support material for their events such as web and intranet sites, videos, and other communications pieces.</p>

<p>In its resolution declaring 20 October 2015 as <a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/2015/06/03/general-assembly-resolution/" target="_blank">the second World Statistics Day</a>, the United Nations General Assembly noted that this year also marks the bicentenary of the birth of George Boole, whose work on the application of the principles of logic as a form of algebra underpins modern computer science. A new 58-minute film commissioned by <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">University College Cork </a>shines new light on the legacy of George Boole, recognised as the forefather of the information age.</p>

<p>The huge impact of George Boole’s work on technology today is explored in <a href="http://www.georgeboole.com/film/" target="_blank">The Genius of George Boole</a>, a stunning new film narrated by Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons and produced by multi award-winning Oxford Film and Television.  It assembles academics and industry leaders from across the globe to explore the life and importance of one of the world’s greatest unsung heroes.</p>

<p>World-renowned film producer and Ireland’s digital champion, Lord Puttnam, sets film with the question: “Is George Boole important?” Puttnam continues: “I guess, no George Boole, no Google, no Amazon, no Intel…that makes him pretty important,” leaving no doubt that Boole is indeed a key figure in our digital age. Dealing with the themes of genius and what motivates genius, the film looks at Boole’s legacy with special references to how Boole research has been applied in today’s world. The film also touches on the historic contexts of Ireland, Cork and UCC as well as England in the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The film, which was recently shown on national television in Ireland, will be shown at the United Nations HQ in New York on World Statistics Day courtesy of the <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">University College Cork</a> in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/pmun/newyork/" target="_blank">Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Labor</a> will induct <a href="http://www.bls.gov/home.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> Commissioners <a href="http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/wright.htm" target="_blank">Carroll D. Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/norwood.htm" target="_blank">Janet L. Norwood</a> into the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/" target="_blank">Labor Hall of Honor</a> on Tuesday, 20 October 2015 at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Carroll Wright was the first BLS Commissioner, serving from 1885 to 1905. Janet Norwood, who passed away recently, was the first woman to serve as BLS Commissioner and led the Bureau for 12 crucial years (1979-1991), modernizing it and raising the profile of its work. Both former Commissioners ensured BLS produced the high quality of statistics necessary to the proper functioning of a democratic government. This will be the first time BLS Commissioners will be inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.</p>

<p>The Hall of Honor was established in 1988 to honor those Americans whose distinctive contributions in the field of labor have elevated working conditions, wages, and over-all quality of life of America’s working families. Recent inductees include former U.S. Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiRPjwRtOGg" target="_blank">Edward “Ted” M. Kennedy</a> and the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/2014_railroad.htm" target="_blank">Chinese Railroad Workers</a>.</p>

<p>During their time as Commissioner, Wright and Norwood each strongly emphasized the necessity of accurate data to help workers suffering from economic hardships. Their legacy lives on as the tangible results of their many accomplishments still impact workers today. On World Statistics Day, we look forward to honoring the achievements of both Wright and Norwood during the Hall of Honor Induction Ceremony.</p>

<p><img src="https://worldstatisticsday.org/images/ban_ki-moon_portrait.jpg" alt="UN Secretary-General portrait" style="width:200px" /><br /><br />In a letter to the heads of state dated 19 August 2015, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, invited governments around the World to lend their full and timely support to make the 2015 World Statistics Day a success, and encouraged them to share with the global community their plans in relation to this celebration.</p>

<p>The Secretary-General pointed out in his letter that “statistics are critical for evidence-based decision making across all cultural and historical backgrounds of countries and irrespective of their level of development.”  He also noted that, by <a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/2015/06/03/general-assembly-resolution/" target="_blank">designating 20 October 2015 as World Statistic Day</a> under the general theme “Better data, better lives”, the United Nations General Assembly “acknowledged the fundamental importance of sustainable national statistical capacity to produce reliable and timely statistics and indicators.”   The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.</p>

<p>In his message to all heads of state, the Secretary-General underlined that “solid data are an indispensable basis for informed policy formulation and for monitoring the post-2015 development agenda at the national, regional and international levels.”  This aspect has particular significance today, as countries are finalizing more than two years of preparations which will culminate next month in the United Nations <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit" target="_blank">summit</a> for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, making a clear call for “quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggragated data…to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure no one is left behind”.</p>

<p>The full text of the Secretary-General’s letter is available here:</p>
