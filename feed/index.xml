<p>The <a href="http://www.dol.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Labor</a> will induct <a href="http://www.bls.gov/home.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> Commissioners <a href="http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/wright.htm" target="_blank">Carroll D. Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/norwood.htm" target="_blank">Janet L. Norwood</a> into the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/" target="_blank">Labor Hall of Honor</a> on Tuesday, 20 October 2015 at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Carroll Wright was the first BLS Commissioner, serving from 1885 to 1905. Janet Norwood, who passed away recently, was the first woman to serve as BLS Commissioner and led the Bureau for 12 crucial years (1979-1991), modernizing it and raising the profile of its work. Both former Commissioners ensured BLS produced the high quality of statistics necessary to the proper functioning of a democratic government. This will be the first time BLS Commissioners will be inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.</p>

<p>The Hall of Honor was established in 1988 to honor those Americans whose distinctive contributions in the field of labor have elevated working conditions, wages, and over-all quality of life of America’s working families. Recent inductees include former U.S. Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiRPjwRtOGg" target="_blank">Edward “Ted” M. Kennedy</a> and the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/2014_railroad.htm" target="_blank">Chinese Railroad Workers</a>.</p>

<p>During their time as Commissioner, Wright and Norwood each strongly emphasized the necessity of accurate data to help workers suffering from economic hardships. Their legacy lives on as the tangible results of their many accomplishments still impact workers today. On World Statistics Day, we look forward to honoring the achievements of both Wright and Norwood during the Hall of Honor Induction Ceremony.</p>

<p><img src="https://worldstatisticsday.org/images/ban_ki-moon_portrait.jpg" alt="UN Secretary-General portrait" style="width:200px" /><br /><br />In a letter to the heads of state dated 19 August 2015, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, invited governments around the World to lend their full and timely support to make the 2015 World Statistics Day a success, and encouraged them to share with the global community their plans in relation to this celebration.</p>

<p>The Secretary-General pointed out in his letter that “statistics are critical for evidence-based decision making across all cultural and historical backgrounds of countries and irrespective of their level of development.”  He also noted that, by <a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/2015/06/03/general-assembly-resolution/" target="_blank">designating 20 October 2015 as World Statistic Day</a> under the general theme “Better data, better lives”, the United Nations General Assembly “acknowledged the fundamental importance of sustainable national statistical capacity to produce reliable and timely statistics and indicators.”   The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.</p>

<p>In his message to all heads of state, the Secretary-General underlined that “solid data are an indispensable basis for informed policy formulation and for monitoring the post-2015 development agenda at the national, regional and international levels.”  This aspect has particular significance today, as countries are finalizing more than two years of preparations which will culminate next month in the United Nations <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit" target="_blank">summit</a> for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, making a clear call for “quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggragated data…to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure no one is left behind”.</p>

<p>The full text of the Secretary-General’s letter is available here:</p>
