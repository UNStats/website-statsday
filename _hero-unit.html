    Official statistics help decision makers adopt policies with impact on
    millions of people. New data sources and statistical methods promise better
    data that feeds into better policies that eventually result in better lives
    for all of us. On 20&nbsp;October&nbsp;2015, the global statistical
    community will showcase their achievements and their ongoing work to help
    this vision come true.
