# About World Statistics Day 2015

The World Statistics Day was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010 to recognize the importance of statistics in shaping our societies. The holding of national and regional statistical days was already a tradition in [more than 100 countries](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/statistics_day/Statistics_Day.htm), but the General Assembly's adoption of this international day as 20 October brought new light to this important observance. The [first World Statistics Day was commemorated on 20&nbsp;October&nbsp;2010](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/wsd/Default.aspx) in over 130 countries and areas.  

The year of 2015 marks an important cornerstone for official statistics, with the conclusion of the [Millennium Development Goals](http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Default.aspx), the [post-2015 development agenda](http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml), the [data revolution](http://www.undatarevolution.org/), the preparations for the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme and so much more.  

We hope that the statistical community worldwide will embrace this international observance and showcase their achievements and their ongoing work towards Better Data - Better Lives.
