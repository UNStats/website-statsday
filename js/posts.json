Firstly, the CSO has partnered with the [Portuguese Exploristica] (http://www.exploristica.com/) team to bring Exploristica, an engaging, interactive set of educational games, to Ireland. The CSO has partnered with the [Lifetime Labs] (http://www.lifetimelab.ie/) in Cork to curate this exhibition and will launch this project on World Statistics Day. Initially, Exploristica will be exhibited in the Lifetime Labs, but, it is easily transportable so it will make a tour of Ireland through regular annual events like the [BT Young Scientist] (http://btyoungscientist.com/) and [SciFest] (http://scifest.ie/) as well as being curated in other cities.\n\n Secondly, CSO will publish our [Statistical Yearbook of Ireland 2015] (http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/statisticalyearbookofireland/) on World Statistics Day. The Statistical Yearbook of Ireland 2015 presents a comprehensive picture of Ireland today. It provides detailed information, tables and graphs across a wide range of topics. These include the population, labour market, education, crime, the economy, agriculture, industry, services, prices, housing, and the environment. The yearbook is published as a mobile friendly web publication.\n\n Thirdly, the CSO will partner with [University College Cork] (http://www.ucc.ie) to present a series of short presentations on statistical topics of interest. Statistics will engage the audience will topics like open data and big data and will provide a window to our statistics products and services as well as our wealth of data.\n\n World Statistics Day will build on the CSO outreach work in [Maths Week] (http://www.mathsweek.ie/), taking place a week earlier in Ireland where over a quarter of a million students engage in all things mathematical. During Maths Week the CSO Director General Padraig Dalton will launch our new [CensusAtSchool questionnaire] (http://www.censusatschool.ie/en/take-part/questionnaires/phase15-16), Felix Coleman, a CSO statistician, will publish the finding of the CensusAtSchool 2014/2015 questionnaire. Minister Damien Engliah TD, Minister of State for Skills, Research and Innovation will launch our [statistical poster competition] (http://www.cso.ie/en/studentscorner/johnhoopermedalforstatisticscompetition/) and our [app building competition](http://apps4gaps.ie/). In addition, there will be lots of engagement at school level with themed school visits.\n\n Ireland has an exciting two weeks ahead with World Statistics Day and Maths week creating plenty of opportunities to engage."

It calls for 'a true data revolution' in order to properly be able to measure progress against the UN's ambitious new [Sustainable Development Goals] (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld). The statement urges that the opportunities provided by new technology and big data are properly utilised, emphasising that national statistical systems are central to this effort. To this end, the statement continues, 'systems must be properly financed, the development of statistical skills and expertise must be supported, and access to new tools and technology must be provided.'\n\n On the evening of WSD, the RSS is hosting a [reception] (http://www.statslife.org.uk/events/events-calendar/eventdetail/501/-/royal-statistical-society-celebrates-world-statistics-day-2015) for members and supporters of the society, as well as from partner organisations we have worked with throughout the past year. The event will include short speeches by the national statistician John Pullinger and Claire Melamed from the Overseas Development Institute who wrote a recent [report] (http://www.undatarevolution.org/report/) for the UN Secretary General on a ‘data revolution’ for international development. A number of local [events] (http://www.statslife.org.uk/events/events-calendar) are also planned for the day.\n\n 20 October also happens to be the day that the RSS’ training for Members of Parliament will take place in parliament following our [Parliament Counts campaign] (http://www.rss.org.uk/rss/influencing_change/lobby_election_candidates/rss/influencing_change/lobby_election_candidates.aspx?hkey=51a5581b-e36f-4f6b-92d0-8e9299133fcd). The campaign sent thousands of messagesbto candidates around the country during the election campaign earlier in 2015, resulting in 324 candidates across the political spectrum signing up to the campaign, of which 55 are now elected members of parliament.\n\n Finally, the RSS will publish a World Statistics Day issue issue of [Significance magazine] (http://www.statslife.org.uk/significance) with six articles, all focusing on the importance of measuring sustainable development, all being made open access for a limited time from 20 October onwards. Claire Melamed will talk about how close we are to achieving a 'data revolution', while other articles focus on how statistics have been employed to examine issues as diverse as undernourishment, slavery and trends in travel."

The workshop was attended by 36 second-year students of [the Vilnius College of Technologies and Design] (http://www.dizainokolegija.lt/lt/) – to familiarise themselves with official statistics and, with the help of statisticians, to create infographics, presenting a statistical message in an attractive manner.\n\n At the beginning of the event, the students received information about the World Statistics Day, familiarised themselves with Statistics Lithuania, the main principles behind the production and dissemination of official statistics, the Official Statistics Portal, the Database of Indicators, etc.\n\n After a lunchbreak, work proceeded in small (four-student) groups. A statistician joined each group; the statistician helped the students to better understand the statistical domain selected, discover interesting statistics and come to a solution how to visualise them via infographics. For many students, it was not an easy task. “I had no idea that statistics covers such a wide range of topics. I am totally lost.”, said one of the participants. However, after three hours of intensive work, all student groups presented the first draft infographics.\n\n After the creative workshop, future designers will continue working individually and finalise the infographics by the World Statistics Day, commemorated on 20 October.\n\n “Our cooperation with the Vilnius College of Technologies and Design dates back many years. This mutual work provides students an opportunity to scrutinise an almost unfamiliar area, learn to find information in the abundance of data, use the Official Statistics Portal. As for our specialists, it is a great opportunity for them to try to explain complicated things in a simple language, look at the results of their work from a user's perspective”, said the Director General of Statistics Lithuania Vilija Lapėnienė in her introductory speech.\n\n More information on the event can be found [here](http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/home/-/asset_publisher/lbrXvLVHX2ln/content/studentu-kurybines-dirbtuves-lietuvos-statistikos-departamente?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.gov.lt%2Fen%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_lbrXvLVHX2ln%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-3%26p_p_col_count%3D1)."

There is an increasingly large amount of data available either publicly or available to scientists across the globe.

It assembles academics and industry leaders from across the globe to explore the life and importance of one of the world’s greatest unsung heroes.\n\nWorld-renowned film producer and Ireland’s digital champion, Lord Puttnam, sets film with the question: “Is George Boole important?” Puttnam continues: “I guess, no George Boole, no Google, no Amazon, no Intel…that makes him pretty important,” leaving no doubt that Boole is indeed a key figure in our digital age. Dealing with the themes of genius and what motivates genius, the film looks at Boole’s legacy with special references to how Boole research has been applied in today’s world. The film also touches on the historic contexts of Ireland, Cork and UCC as well as England in the early nineteenth century.\n\nThe film, which was recently shown on national television in Ireland, will be shown at the United Nations HQ in New York on World Statistics Day courtesy of the [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) in cooperation with the [Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations](https://www.dfa.ie/pmun/newyork/)."

Janet Norwood, who passed away recently, was the first woman to serve as BLS Commissioner and led the Bureau for 12 crucial years (1979-1991), modernizing it and raising the profile of its work. Both former Commissioners ensured BLS produced the high quality of statistics necessary to the proper functioning of a democratic government. This will be the first time BLS Commissioners will be inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.\n\nThe Hall of Honor was established in 1988 to honor those Americans whose distinctive contributions in the field of labor have elevated working conditions, wages, and over-all quality of life of America’s working families. Recent inductees include former U.S. Senator [Edward “Ted” M.
