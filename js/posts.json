Among other things, this indicator framework will require the collection of disaggregated data to ensure that no one is left behind, including ethnic and other vulnerable population groups.\n\n It is expected that the event will be inaugurated by the President of Peru, Mr. Ollanta Humala, and will count with international and national participants, including statisticians, decision makers, researchers, and organizations."

A new 58-minute film commissioned by [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) shines new light on the legacy of George Boole, recognised as the forefather of the information age.\n\nThe huge impact of George Boole’s work on technology today is explored in [The Genius of George Boole](http://www.georgeboole.com/film/), a stunning new film narrated by Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons and produced by multi award-winning Oxford Film and Television. It assembles academics and industry leaders from across the globe to explore the life and importance of one of the world’s greatest unsung heroes.\n\nWorld-renowned film producer and Ireland’s digital champion, Lord Puttnam, sets film with the question: “Is George Boole important?” Puttnam continues: “I guess, no George Boole, no Google, no Amazon, no Intel…that makes him pretty important,” leaving no doubt that Boole is indeed a key figure in our digital age. Dealing with the themes of genius and what motivates genius, the film looks at Boole’s legacy with special references to how Boole research has been applied in today’s world. The film also touches on the historic contexts of Ireland, Cork and UCC as well as England in the early nineteenth century.\n\nThe film, which was recently shown on national television in Ireland, will be shown at the United Nations HQ in New York on World Statistics Day courtesy of the [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) in cooperation with the [Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations](https://www.dfa.ie/pmun/newyork/)."

Janet Norwood, who passed away recently, was the first woman to serve as BLS Commissioner and led the Bureau for 12 crucial years (1979-1991), modernizing it and raising the profile of its work. Both former Commissioners ensured BLS produced the high quality of statistics necessary to the proper functioning of a democratic government. This will be the first time BLS Commissioners will be inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.\n\nThe Hall of Honor was established in 1988 to honor those Americans whose distinctive contributions in the field of labor have elevated working conditions, wages, and over-all quality of life of America’s working families. Recent inductees include former U.S. Senator [Edward “Ted” M. Kennedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiRPjwRtOGg) and the [Chinese Railroad Workers](http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/2014_railroad.htm).\n\nDuring their time as Commissioner, Wright and Norwood each strongly emphasized the necessity of accurate data to help workers suffering from economic hardships. Their legacy lives on as the tangible results of their many accomplishments still impact workers today. On World Statistics Day, we look forward to honoring the achievements of both Wright and Norwood during the Hall of Honor Induction Ceremony."

      "text": "To mark World Statistics Day, [Significance Magazine](http://www.statslife.org.uk/significance) will devote its October 2015 issue to articles highlighting important contributions of statistics in different parts of the world. Significance Magazine is an official publication of both the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS)](http://www.rss.org.uk/) and the [American Statistical Association (ASA)](http://www.amstat.org/).\n\nThe magazine is planning to publish one article from each of the main geographic regions: North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.\n\nWe are particularly keen that articles published about the developing world do not fall into the \"bad news\" trap - that is, focusing only on stories of war, death, disease, poverty, and natural disasters,\"says Significance Editor Brian Tarran. Instead, the magazine is seeking tales of interesting work and novel applications of statistics from parts of the planet that are too often overlooked by the media, he adds.\n\nYou can send your article ideas or recommendations of potential contributors to Brian at [b.tarran@rss.org.uk](mailto:b.tarran@rss.org.uk)."

      "text": "The campaign for World Statistics Day 2015, which will take place on 20 October 2015, was officially launched today during the [46th Session of the UN Statistical Commission](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/commission_46th_session.htm) with the theme \"Better data. Better lives\". During the launch the official logo was revealed with an animation.\n\nThe logo is a play on a percentage symbol (representing statistics) and a smiling face. It evokes the idea of how statistics inform and support people around the world and thus contribute to achieve a healthy and happy society.\n\n2015, the year of the second World Statistics Day, marks an important cornerstone for official statistics, with the conclusion of the [Millennium Development Goals](http://mdgs.un.org/), the beginning of the [post-2015 development agenda](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015), the ongoing [data revolution](http://www.undatarevolution.org/), preparations for the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme and so much more.\n\nThe [first World Statistics Day](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/wsd/) was commemorated on 20 October 2010 in over 130 countries and areas. World Statistics Day 2015 will be celebrated globally with local events organized by national statistical offices, statistical organizations, UN organizations and universities.\n\nThis website features all events for World Statistics Day 2015.
