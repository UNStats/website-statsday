The workshop was attended by 36 second-year students of [the Vilnius College of Technologies and Design] (http://www.dizainokolegija.lt/lt/) – to familiarise themselves with official statistics and, with the help of statisticians, to create infographics, presenting a statistical message in an attractive manner.\n\n At the beginning of the event, the students received information about the World Statistics Day, familiarised themselves with Statistics Lithuania, the main principles behind the production and dissemination of official statistics, the Official Statistics Portal, the Database of Indicators, etc.\n\n After a lunchbreak, work proceeded in small (four-student) groups. A statistician joined each group; the statistician helped the students to better understand the statistical domain selected, discover interesting statistics and come to a solution how to visualise them via infographics. For many students, it was not an easy task. “I had no idea that statistics covers such a wide range of topics. I am totally lost.”, said one of the participants. However, after three hours of intensive work, all student groups presented the first draft infographics.\n\n After the creative workshop, future designers will continue working individually and finalise the infographics by the World Statistics Day, commemorated on 20 October.\n\n “Our cooperation with the Vilnius College of Technologies and Design dates back many years. This mutual work provides students an opportunity to scrutinise an almost unfamiliar area, learn to find information in the abundance of data, use the Official Statistics Portal. As for our specialists, it is a great opportunity for them to try to explain complicated things in a simple language, look at the results of their work from a user's perspective”, said the Director General of Statistics Lithuania Vilija Lapėnienė in her introductory speech.\n\n More information on the event can be found [here](http://www.stat.gov.lt/en/home/-/asset_publisher/lbrXvLVHX2ln/content/studentu-kurybines-dirbtuves-lietuvos-statistikos-departamente?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.gov.lt%2Fen%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_lbrXvLVHX2ln%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-3%26p_p_col_count%3D1)."

On 7 March 2014, MH370 carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing lost contact with air traffic control and was subsequently reported missing. In his talk, Gordon, a member of the [Australian Transport Safety Bureau] (http://www.atsb.gov.au) search advisory team, will show how Bayesian statistical estimation methods have been used to process the [Inmarsat] (http://www.inmarsat.com/) data and produce a probability distribution of MH370 flight paths that defines the current search zone in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n Darnell will present a talk titled “Data Literacy in a World of Big Data”. There is an increasingly large amount of data available either publicly or available to scientists across the globe. Making honest predictions from these data is not necessarily determined by quantity. Even large datasets can be generated with limitations that define their quality. In his talk, Darnell will argue data scientists need to be trained to understand these limitations of empirical evidence.\n\n In the opening session, Professor Shahjahan Khan, the event organiser, will provide a brief introduction on “Why World Statistics Day?”"

A new 58-minute film commissioned by [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) shines new light on the legacy of George Boole, recognised as the forefather of the information age.\n\nThe huge impact of George Boole’s work on technology today is explored in [The Genius of George Boole](http://www.georgeboole.com/film/), a stunning new film narrated by Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons and produced by multi award-winning Oxford Film and Television. It assembles academics and industry leaders from across the globe to explore the life and importance of one of the world’s greatest unsung heroes.\n\nWorld-renowned film producer and Ireland’s digital champion, Lord Puttnam, sets film with the question: “Is George Boole important?” Puttnam continues: “I guess, no George Boole, no Google, no Amazon, no Intel…that makes him pretty important,” leaving no doubt that Boole is indeed a key figure in our digital age. Dealing with the themes of genius and what motivates genius, the film looks at Boole’s legacy with special references to how Boole research has been applied in today’s world. The film also touches on the historic contexts of Ireland, Cork and UCC as well as England in the early nineteenth century.\n\nThe film, which was recently shown on national television in Ireland, will be shown at the United Nations HQ in New York on World Statistics Day courtesy of the [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/) in cooperation with the [Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations](https://www.dfa.ie/pmun/newyork/)."

Janet Norwood, who passed away recently, was the first woman to serve as BLS Commissioner and led the Bureau for 12 crucial years (1979-1991), modernizing it and raising the profile of its work. Both former Commissioners ensured BLS produced the high quality of statistics necessary to the proper functioning of a democratic government. This will be the first time BLS Commissioners will be inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor.\n\nThe Hall of Honor was established in 1988 to honor those Americans whose distinctive contributions in the field of labor have elevated working conditions, wages, and over-all quality of life of America’s working families. Recent inductees include former U.S. Senator [Edward “Ted” M. Kennedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiRPjwRtOGg) and the [Chinese Railroad Workers](http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/2014_railroad.htm).\n\nDuring their time as Commissioner, Wright and Norwood each strongly emphasized the necessity of accurate data to help workers suffering from economic hardships. Their legacy lives on as the tangible results of their many accomplishments still impact workers today. On World Statistics Day, we look forward to honoring the achievements of both Wright and Norwood during the Hall of Honor Induction Ceremony."

Instead, the magazine is seeking tales of interesting work and novel applications of statistics from parts of the planet that are too often overlooked by the media, he adds.\n\nYou can send your article ideas or recommendations of potential contributors to Brian at [b.tarran@rss.org.uk](mailto:b.tarran@rss.org.uk)."
