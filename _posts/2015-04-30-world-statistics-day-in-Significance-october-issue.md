To mark the World Statistics Day, [*Significance magazine*](http://www.statslife.org.uk/significance) will devote its October 2015 issue to articles highlighting important contributions of statistics in different parts of the world. [*Significance*](http://www.statslife.org.uk/significance) is an official magazine of both the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS)](http://www.rss.org.uk/) and the [American Statistical Association (ASA)](http://www.amstat.org/).

The magazine is planning to publish one article from each of the main geographic regions: North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. “We are particularly keen that articles published about the developing world do not fall into the “bad news” trap—that is, focusing only on stories of war, death, disease, poverty, and natural disasters,” says Significance Editor Brian Tarran. Instead, the magazine is seeking tales of interesting work and novel applications of statistics from parts of the planet that are too often overlooked by the media, he adds.

Please send article ideas or recommendations for potential contributors to Tarran at <b.tarran@rss.org.uk>.
