The campaign for World Statistics Day 2015, which will take place on **20 October 2015**, was officially launched today during the 46th Session of the UN Statistical Commission with the theme: *Better data. Better lives.* During the launch the official logo was revealed with an animation.

The logo *‘Stat Happy’* is a play on a percentage symbol (representing statistics) and a smiling face. It evokes the idea of how statistics inform and support people around the world and thus contribute to achieve a healthy, happy society.

2015, the year of the second World Statistics Day, marks an important cornerstone for official statistics, with the conclusion of the Millennium Development Goals, the beginning of the post-2015 development agenda, the ongoing data revolution, preparations for the 2020 World Population and Housing Census Programme and so much more.

The first World Statistics Day was commemorated on 20 October 2010 in over 130 countries and areas.
