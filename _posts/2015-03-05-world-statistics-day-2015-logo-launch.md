In order to mark 2015's World Statistics Day, the United Nations Statistics Division engaged the award winning team of UN designers in developing a logo that embodies the theme: *Better data. Better lives.*


The result is this brilliantly simple logo: a smiling face, a globe, a percentage sign. The logo evokes the idea of statistics making it possible to better lives of people, globally. The blue colour scheme conveys universality and professionalism, and alludes to the pillars of the United Nations.

The logo is expected to be adopted by national statistical systems and international organizations in their commemorations of World Statistics Day 2015, following the successful 2010 experience.
